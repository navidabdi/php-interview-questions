## Beginner Level

### 1. What is PHP?

PHP is a server-side scripting language that is used to develop Static websites or Dynamic websites or Web applications. PHP stands for Hypertext Pre-processor, that earlier stood for Personal Home Pages. PHP scripts can only be interpreted on a server that has PHP installed.

### 2. What is the difference between static and dynamic websites?

Static Websites: Static websites can be described as simple websites. The content can be the same for all users. Static websites are written in HTML and CSS. They do not require any web programming or database design. They are easy to develop and host.
Dynamic Websites: Dynamic websites can be described as complex websites. The content can vary for different users. Dynamic websites are written in languages such as CGI, AJAX, ASP, ASP.NET, etc. They are comparatively difficult to develop and host.
